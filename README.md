"Snake Game Update:
This is another Java project I've been actively developing. Initially, I implemented the controls I had created two days ago. Today, I introduced a basic scoring system and an interesting challenge: once the player reaches a score of 50 points, the snake's speed will ramp up.

20/9/2023: I incorporated controls, snake movement, apple spawning, and collision detection, making the game over when necessary.

27/9/2023: I've now included a highscore system that keeps track of your best score achieved in the Snake game.

1/10/2023: Just added a obstacles such as some walls to give a challange and made a portal warp from one side to another while going out of the screen.

3/10/2023: Finally fix and added a Progression System where each level you pass and get 100 points, wall obstacles will be added during the game and also fixed some potential food spawn inside walls.

4/10/2023: "It took some time, but I finally implemented a cool feature where the snake can shoot the wall to create a passage.
