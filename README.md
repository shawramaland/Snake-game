"Snake Game Update:
This is another Java project I've been actively developing. Initially, I implemented the controls I had created two days ago. Today, I introduced a basic scoring system and an interesting challenge: once the player reaches a score of 50 points, the snake's speed will ramp up.

September 20, 2023: I incorporated controls, snake movement, apple spawning, and collision detection, making the game over when necessary.

September 27, 2023: I've now included a highscore system that keeps track of your best score achieved in the Snake game."
